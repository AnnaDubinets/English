Hi RÃ³wan,

I am writing to ask you about our classes. Please tell me what day and what time will our next lesson be? I'm asking because I need to make my plan for next week.
I also want to inform you that I completed my homework for last Friday. I am attaching a file to this letter. Please take a look.

Thank you in advance.

Best wishes, Anna!
